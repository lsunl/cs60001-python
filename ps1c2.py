From MIT OpenCourseWare Intro. to Computational Thinking and Data Science

Create a program to determine the best percentage of salary to save for a three-year
period to generate a 25% down payment for a home. User enters an annual salary.
There is a constant 7% semi-annual raise, 4% rate of return on savings, and
a home cost of $1,000,000. It is possible, depending on initial salary, that the
user will be unable to save the down payment in the three year period.
